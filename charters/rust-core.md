# Rust Core Working Group Charter

**Start Date**: June 6th 2024

**End Date**: Unknown

**DRI**: Kendall Weihe

## Motivation and Background

This working group will streamline and standardize the implementations of the open standards presented by the web5 and tbdex Working Groups.

ðŸš§ image: web5 & tbdex WGs feed into rust code which feeds into kt and swift ðŸš§

SDKs for web5 and tbdex have been implemented across TypeScript ([web5-js](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js/) & [tbdex-js](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-js/)), Kotlin ([web5-kt](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-kt/) & [tbdex-kt](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-kt/)), Swift ([web5-swift](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-swift/) & [tbdex-swift](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-swift/)), Golang ([web5-go](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-go/) & [tbdex-go](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-go/)), and Dart ([web5-dart](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-dart/) & [tbdex-dart](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-dart/)). Streamlining the implementation's for web5 and tbdex by implementing "core" logic in Rust, and then binding the solution into the target language, offers many benefits. The benefits of Rust Core include but are not limited to:

- Strong interoperability assurances.
- Reduce maintenance burden for particularly dense feature sets (ex. did:dht).
- Serve as a Schelling Point for matters of implementation governance.
- Contain a convenient location for a historical record of decisions-made.

Rust is uniquely qualified as the solution to a core implementation which is deployed cross-platform because of open source tooling availability through WASM and UniFFI. Furthermore, Rust has a broad array of open source support, and Rust has the unique feature of memory safety (relative to alternatives such as C).

## Scope

The comprehensive implementations of the web5 and tbdex specifications across Rust, Kotlin and Swift are within the scope of this Working Group. Alongside of each implementation, documentation comments ("doc comments"), test vectors & integrations, example usages, and CI/CD solutions (eg. security analysis, test automation, artifact version & publication, etc.) are all within scope of this Working Group. 

The Rust Core Working Group will make an intentional effort to prioritize matters of security and performance. Furthermore, with regards to API design & developer experience (DX), this Working Group will prioritize first and foremost modularity and extensibility, over DX convenience, in order to limit the liklihood of introducing breaking changes to consumers of the delivered SDKs.

The Rust Core Working Group is not concerned with the definitions of the web5 and tbdex specifications, both of which are the concerns of the respective Working Group. However, the Rust Core Working Group will offer valuable feedback mechanisms to the web5 and tbdex Working Groups and so although the web5 and tbdex specifications are not within the scope of this Working Group, a considerable amount of cross-Working Group collaboration is to be expected (see [Coordination](#coordination) and [Communication](#communication) below).

The Rust Core Working Group codifies a standard API Design (ðŸš§ link to APID deliverables ðŸš§) which is implemented across all supported language implementations (Rust, Kotlin and Swift), but any additional API features or design characteristics are not within the scope of this Working Group. Each implementation must support the standard API Design as a baseline implementation, but does not exclude the possibility of additional features.

## Deliverables

**Scope of Work**:

- Custom DSL which is conceptually compatible with all target languages.
- Codification of the API Design using the Custom DSL.
