# tbDEX Working Group Charter

**Start Date**: June 10, 2024

**End Date**: December 31, 2024

**DRI**: [Moe Jangda](https://github.com/mistermoe)

## Motivation and Background

tbDEX is an open-source protocol that can be used to move value between N parties. It relies on Web5 primitives such as Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials to enable secure, decentralized value exchanges without intermediaries.

This working group serves as a meeting point to discuss and improve the existing protocol and the resulting implementation(s), which will provide developers with the tools they need to build Participating Financial Institutions and Wallets that speak tbDEX.

## Scope

* Discussing, defining and implementing the tbDEX API surface that will best suit the needs of those who are using it in the real world
* Discussing how updates to Web5 libraries impact tbDEX, and coming up with ways to adjust the tbDEX API as needed
* Design and implement additional transport for tbDEX messaging

## Deliverables

### 1. tbDEX Protocol Specification
Description: Develop and maintain the [tbDEX Protocol Specification](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/protocol)

### 2. tbDEX HTTP API Specification
Description: Develop and maintain the [tbDEX HTTP API Specification](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/tree/main/specs/http-api)

### 3. tbDEX Interop Specification

## Success Criteria

### 1. tbDEX Protocol Specification

### 2. tbDEX HTTP API Specification


## Coordination
This group favors document-driven coordination, documenting communications and decisions. The group will be facilitated via the Technical Steering Comittee and the set of repositories specific to each of the work items and deliverables listed above, making use of GitHub Issues and a common GitHub project for the entire Working Group's corpus.

The Working Group will closely collaborate with the Web5 Working Group to ensure alignment and support for the tbDEX protocol and requirements. Similarly, the Working Group will coordinate closely with the Rust Working Group for the uptake of a Rust Core throughout the Web5 SDKs. Coordination will surface through the TSC, associated GitHub repositories, and communication tools (Slack, Discord).


## Communication
The working group will communicate primarily in a written manner via GitHub: filing issues and Requests for Comments (RFCs) directly to the respective GitHub repository, primarily within the [tbDEX GitHub repository](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex).

The group will establish dedicated public and private communication channels as necessary (e.g., TBD Slack, TBD Discord) for real-time discussions and quick resolution of issues.

The Working Group DRI will coordinate weekly updates for each of the group's work items, with the respective DRIs of each work item, to share with the TSC.
