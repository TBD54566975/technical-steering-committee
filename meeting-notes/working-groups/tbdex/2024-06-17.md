## Agenda
frank diane nick gabe ethan jiyoon moe

## Notes
- cancel, rate, region issues: consensus reached, need to write up some PRs
- PR ready for issue #323
  - because it feels overkill to send payment details as part of the RFQ
  - https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/323#issuecomment-2136654060 
  - would be nice for offering to surface all required payment details (for what alice will need during rfq AND order)
  - pfi risk assessment is dynamic - unable to statically represent this during offering.
  - quote is like putting this dynamic risk assessment requirement bucket after rfq before quote

- #327
  - :checkmark: message + replyTo in the rfq, message in order / close

- cancel / refund: PR not up yet, up for others to take up

- #331 amount / fee
  - amount is not fee inclusive
  - totalAmount: the final number user pays
  - total: subtotal + fee
  - subtotal: 
  - rate: 
  - fee: 
  - quote.rate: set at top same level as payin and payout
  - is payout.fee necessary? 
```json
fees: [{
  "description": "payin",
  "amount": "500,000",
  "currency": "USD",
}, {
  "description": "payout",
  "amount": "1,000,000",
  "currency": "MXN"
}]
```
## Action Items

- is payout.fee necessary?
