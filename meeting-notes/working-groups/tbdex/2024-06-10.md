## Agenda

- Questions around deliverables being written in the [charter](https://github.com/TBD54566975/technical-steering-committee/pull/13)
- Pick and discuss an issue tagged `needs discussion / decision` from [tbdex repo](https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues)

## Notes

- thinking through refund flow https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/319
- frank: need a consistent way to let the app know there's another step to be taken
- angie: this q came up on every talk and workshop
  - the common answer given was "it depends on the PFI" but that wasn't well received as tbdex should be an interface for various PFIs
- moe: will go over this and narrow idea down to 1

- adding a cancel message https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/328 
- frank: these two issues are connected, maybe have a common generic data structure that covers both scenarios

- adding region data to Offering https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/324
  - frank: may want to be able to specify the currency PLUS region, as region doesn't necessarily dictate currency
  - is `region` required as a top level field?
    - `region` indicates this offering supports customers originating 
      - maybe need a better name to describe the above definition
      - `thisOfferingCanSupportCustomersOriginatingIn`
  - can work as top level field, as well as `payin.region` and `payout.region`
  - would be good to get feedback from african fintech companies since many african countries accept multiple currencies for a region.
  - from wallet perspective, we'd want to filter without having to loop through offerings
  - should we introduce a filter by regions? good idea but not in scope of this issue - created issue https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/332
  - examples from other payment services that might motivate different approaches to where to include country/region info in Offerings

- including `rate` in Quote message https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/330 
  - need this field coming back in Quote to lock in a rate
  - nick: for B2C, (cashapp or didpay) rate shown must be rounded to 4 decimal places, but we must use the UNrounded rate to calculate the amount
  - return Quote with UNrounded rates
  - why add this when we can calculate / infer it?
  - quote should include a rate to be blindly shown by the wallet, with the option to validated if needed by wallet

## Action Items
- moe: will narrow idea down to 1 after re-reading https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/319
- need decision logged in https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/324 to make top level `region` (name tbd) required and payin.region and payout.region optional
- frank: when https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/324 has a decison, organize a way to get feedback from african fintech.
- ai: model transferwise westernunion cashapp flow using tbdex
- make a decision on `Quote.rate` https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex/issues/330
