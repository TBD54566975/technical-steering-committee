## Notes

- Assign roles
  - Facilitator: Frank Hinek
  - Note taker: Neal Roessler
- Announcements
  - TBD PFI readiness by end of month, Test Vector readiness, and publishing of maven artifacts
- Publishing of kotlin-core artifacts
  - Current state of publishing: Currently on Jitpack but this is limited and have to manually do a tag
  - Also (almost) have github package available for consumption
  - Github actions build TLDR: create the 4 architecture binaries, copy into resources, run the final build and publish
  - End state will be what Leo and Alr publish with sonatype, going to put a sprint to try and get this out by august 2nd. 
  - Backup will be use jitpack / github packages
- Test Vectors Updates
  - Prioritize Rust and rust bindings code over all other sdks
  - New github action: Whenever you run a new test in the tbdex spec or the web5-spec repo it will run against all sdks againsnt the latest changes in pr.
  - Thinking about versioning of spec, how the sdks align with tbdex spec version. A good first pass can be the runner will have what branch (main or how far behind) the sdk is using for the test vectors
- TBDEX Order Instructions change
  - Making 100% sure we are doing Order Instructions, but can't see why we wouldn't go forward with it. We will most likely be doing this
