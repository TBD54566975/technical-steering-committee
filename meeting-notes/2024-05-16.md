- Guiding principles
    - TSC delegates most decisions and work to Working Groups and focuses on     - prioritization, coordination, and resolving ambiguity. Additionally,     - any work that falls outside the charter of existing groups.
    - TSC is a member-driven organization with representatives from across     - TBD Engineering and each Working Group.
    - Foster a writing culture in which changes to specifications and     - governance processes are proposed as RFCs, which are reviewed by     - Working Groups (or TSC, if applicable).
    - Deliberative decisions with a bias towards action.
- Recommendations for initial work of the TSC:
    - Determining where and how frequently the Committee meets.
    - Establishing the charter for the TSC.
    - Defining the RFC Process for introducing change.
    - Define how Working Groups are chartered.
    - Decide which Working Groups to start with:
      - tbDEX
      - Web5
      - Rust Core
    - Decide how to organize the GitHub repositories that will facilitate TBDâ€™s Open Standards Development (OSD) efforts.
- Clarifications
    - notes
