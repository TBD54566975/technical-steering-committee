## Notes
- Keep meeting notes in the [technical-steering-committee github repo](https://github.com/TBD54566975/technical-steering-committee/tree/main/meeting-notes)
- RFCs should live closest to the project it’s related to under Issues [(example)](https://github.com/TBD54566975/known-customer-credential/issues/27)
- Steering group identifies the need and drives definition around the requirements
- Determines whether there’s a need to stand up a working group, nest into another working group, and identify which members might start a working group
- DRI owns the outcome
- Working groups are public by default
- Working groups should be based on charters
- Charters should have a section demonstrating linking points with other working groups
- Async communication should be done on new Slack channel
