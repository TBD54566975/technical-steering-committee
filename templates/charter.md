Why is this working group necessary? What does it build upon? What does it enable? Is it related to other groups?

## Scope

What exactly is in scope and out of scope for the working group.

## Deliverables

Enumeration of work products for the group. Be as detailed as possible. 

Make sure to classify the deliverables accordingly (e.g. specification, SDK, research report, etc.). Assign DRIs for each deliverable as necessary. Deliverables should each have clear "acceptance criteria" so we know how to measure their completeness.
