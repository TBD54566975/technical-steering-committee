# RFC-0000 - <TODO_TITLE>
[title]: #rfc-0000---todo_title

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

What are the problems that this RFC sets out to solve? Why now? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed Design
[detailed-design]: #detailed-design

This is the main part of the RFC, where you explain the design in sufficient detail for someone
familiar with the project to understand and implement it. This may include:

* Introducing new concepts or terminology
* Explaining the feature or change through examples and use cases
* Providing sample code snippets, API documentation, or migration guidance, if applicable
* Discussing the implications for existing users and how to handle backward compatibility
* Analyzing the impact on readability, understandability, and maintainability

For specification-oriented RFCs, focus on how the change affects the specification itself, its
interpretation, and its implementation in various contexts. Provide concrete examples and explain
the implications for interoperability and conformance.

For software-oriented RFCs, concentrate on how the change influences the architecture, API design,
and usage patterns. Illustrate the impact through code samples and discuss the effects on
performance, security, and developer experience.

In both cases, aim to provide a comprehensive and accessible description of the proposed change,
enabling stakeholders to evaluate its merits and potential drawbacks effectively.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this? There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them
here.

## Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

* Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
* What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
* What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons learned by others
that attempted to tackle a similar problem and inform readers of your RFC who may not know the
history.

If you searched and cannot find any prior art, include a note in this section.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts.  Please consider:

* What parts of the proposal do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets
  merged?
* What parts of the proposal do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this change
  before stabilization?
* What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would
affect the project as a whole. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.  Also, consider how this all fits into the roadmap
for the project.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas," if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but
otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot
think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to
accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale
in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.
